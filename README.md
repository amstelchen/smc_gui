# spectre-meltdown-checker GUI

### A simple GUI for spectre-meltdown-checker

*Meltdown* and *Spectre* are two significant security vulnerabilities that rocked the technology world when they were disclosed in early 2018. Both vulnerabilities affect the majority of modern microprocessors, including those made by Intel, AMD, and ARM.

Meltdown primarily targets Intel processors, while Spectre affects a wider range of chips, including those from AMD and ARM. These vulnerabilities exploit the fundamental design flaws in modern processors that allow malicious programs to access sensitive data in the computer's memory.

**spectre-meltdown-checker** is a shell script written and maintained by StÃ©phane Lesimple to assess your system's resilience against the several transient execution CVEs that were published since early 2018, and give you guidance as to how to mitigate them.

**spectre-meltdown-checker GUI** ist just a simple frontend for *spectre-meltdown-checker*.
